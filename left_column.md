### Course goals and format

This 2-day course is aimed at field ecologists, environmental scientists, climate modellers and biologists interested in improving climate models by better representing terrestrial ecosystems. [FATES](https://fates-docs.readthedocs.io/) is a numerical terrestrial ecosystem model for use in [Earth System Models (ESM)](https://soccom.princeton.edu/content/what-earth-system-model-esm) that simulates and predicts growth, death, and regeneration of plants and subsequent tree size distributions. Participants will learn about climate modelling as well as how to use the [Galaxy Climate JupyterLab](https://live.usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=interactive_tool_climate_notebook){:target="_blank"} for running FATES experiments and compare those with observational data.

This is an informal and interactive event with type-along type
of presentations, live coding, and demos. Short tutorials alternate
with practical exercises.



### Workshop requirements

You need to register to [Galaxy](https://climate.usegalaxy.eu/)  *before* Galaxy CLM-FATES workshop.
Please do this - *and check it* - in advance, otherwise you'll start off
behind.
