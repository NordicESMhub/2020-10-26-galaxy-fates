### Who the course is for

This 2-day course is aimed at field ecologists, environmental scientists, climate modellers and biologists interested in improving climate models by better representing terrestrial ecosystems. [FATES](https://fates-docs.readthedocs.io/) is a numerical terrestrial ecosystem model for use in [Earth System Models (ESM)](https://soccom.princeton.edu/content/what-earth-system-model-esm) that simulates and predicts growth, death, and regeneration of plants and subsequent tree size distributions. Participants will learn about climate modelling as well as how to use the [Galaxy Climate JupyterLab](https://live.usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=interactive_tool_climate_notebook){:target="_blank"} for running FATES experiments and compare those with observational data.
